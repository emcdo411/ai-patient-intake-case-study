# 🏥 AI-Powered Patient Intake & Triage Optimization System

> GitHub-ready case study and LinkedIn-optimized showcase demonstrating how AI can transform clinical workflows, reduce triage delays, and improve operational insight in urgent care environments.

---

## 🔧 Real-World Scenario

**Client Brief:**

> "We need a smarter way to handle patient check-ins across multiple urgent care clinics. The current process is paper-based and delays nurse triage by 10–20 minutes per patient. We want to digitize, prioritize, and integrate — fast."

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Digitize patient intake forms with web/mobile-friendly frontend
* ✅ Auto-triage patients using symptom keyword detection + ML scoring
* ✅ Visualize clinic workload and triage distribution across shifts
* ✅ Integrate structured outputs with EHR system (simulated HL7/FHIR)

## 🔄 Data Flow Example

1. Patient submits symptoms + vitals through tablet or web form
2. FastAPI endpoint calls NLP engine → extracts symptoms (fever, chest pain, etc.)
3. ML model scores urgency level (0–100)
4. Entry stored in PostgreSQL + sent to EHR export queue
5. Clinic dashboard updates with:

   * Patient name, timestamp, symptoms
   * Triage score + color-coded flag
   * Shift volume trend + staff recommendations

## ✅ Part 1: App Strategy – From Demo to Production-Ready

| Goal                    | What to Build                                                      | Why It Matters                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standalone Demo**     | All logic runs on hardcoded or `.csv` data (no live API needed)    | Works offline, easy to demo on GitHub or LinkedIn     |
| **Future Integration**  | API endpoints match real-world EHR structures (e.g., FHIR Bundles) | Prepares the audience for real deployment             |
| **Cost-Efficient API**  | Use `FastAPI + Pydantic`, Docker-ready, SQLite for testing         | Avoids cost creep, runs locally or cloud for pennies  |
| **Shiny Compatibility** | Ensure RShiny can call the FastAPI endpoints or read `.csv`        | Opens dual frontend flexibility for different clients |

---

## 🏗️ Step-by-Step Build Suggestions

### 1. Create a `FastAPI` App with 3 Modes

```python
MODE = os.getenv("MODE", "DEMO")  # Options: DEMO, CSV, API
```

#### 📂 Directory

```
app/
├── main.py         # FastAPI router
├── nlp.py          # spaCy logic
├── model.py        # Scikit-learn triage model
├── config.py       # MODE handler
├── mock_data.py    # Hardcoded patients for demo
├── csv_loader.py   # Optional CSV ingestion
```

#### ✔ API Routes

```python
@app.get("/triage/sample")  # uses hardcoded patient
@app.post("/triage/csv")    # accepts uploaded CSV
@app.post("/triage/fhir")   # accepts FHIR Bundle-like JSON
```

---

### 2. Simulate a Trusted Integration (CareNow-Ready)

While you won’t use real EHR data, **mimic HL7 FHIR** schemas:

* Bundle
* Patient
* Encounter
* Observation

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "entry": [
    { "resource": { "resourceType": "Patient", "name": [{"family": "Jones"}] }},
    { "resource": { "resourceType": "Observation", "code": "heart rate", "valueQuantity": {"value": 110} }}
  ]
}
```

➡ AI logic parses this → NLP extracts symptoms → ML scores urgency → dashboard or JSON output

---

### 3. Make App RShiny-Compatible

In your RShiny app:

* Accept `.csv` files with same schema as the backend
* Add a toggle for `Live API Mode` or `Local Mode`
* For API mode, use:

```r
httr::POST("http://localhost:8000/triage/csv", body = csv_data, encode = "json")
```

---

### 4. Deploy in a Minimal Cost Environment

| Tool                      | Reason                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Render** or **Railway** | Free-tier for `FastAPI` API deployment                      |
| **Docker Compose**        | Easy local orchestration (API + mock dashboard)             |
| **SQLite**                | In-memory database to simulate production flow without cost |
| **RShinyapps.io (free)**  | Deploy lightweight dashboard in R mode                      |
| **Streamlit Cloud**       | Deploy the Python dashboard version (if preferred over R)   |

---

## 🔁 Futureproofing: Add API Docs + Monitoring

* Use `FastAPI`'s built-in OpenAPI support (`/docs`)
* Add response examples for each mode
* Build a simple `healthcheck` endpoint for CI/CD or Shiny integration
* Add logging via `loguru` or `structlog` for production use

---

## ⚙️ ML Model Overview

* Input: Symptoms (text), age, body temp, heart rate
* Engine: `Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier`
* Labels: Urgent / Non-Urgent (trained on synthetic urgent care dataset)
* Output: Score from 0–100 mapped to priority tier:

  * 80–100 = Immediate
  * 60–79 = High
  * 30–59 = Moderate
  * 0–29 = Low

---

## 🧪 Sample FastAPI Endpoint

```python
@app.post("/triage")
async def triage(patient: PatientIntake):
    symptoms = extract_symptoms(patient.symptoms)
    score = predict_triage(patient)
    save_to_db(patient, symptoms, score)
    return {"triage_score": score, "priority": map_priority(score)}
```
